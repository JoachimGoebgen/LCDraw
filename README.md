# LCDraw
Character-recognition for writing on a small touchscreen.

Consists of three seperate python-apps:
- LCDraw-label: Directly label your own characters written on the touchscreen
- LCDraw-train: Train a neural net with your labeled characters
- LCDraw-run: [under construction] recognize characters written on the touchscreen with your trained NN and publish them via MQTT or use this a a basis for your own project
